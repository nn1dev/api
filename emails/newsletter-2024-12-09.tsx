      Let’s kick 2025 off with something different. We are excited to invite you
      to our next meet-up where members of our community will present the
      results of their weekend hacks. Due to very limited slots, please reach
      out as soon as possible if you would like to present something. We really
      hope you will like the new format. Registration is, as always, free and
      open now. Hurry up because the number of tickets is capped at 100.
